# API Trading simulator

## About the project
This project has been developed by Arthur VEROT & Pierre CARETTE.
During our training at Ironhack, we had to realize an API. We chose to build an API to run a [paper trading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market_simulator) app. On this app you can trade over 100 cryptos and 12 000 stocks. To achieve that, we used the [Binance](https://www.binance.com/fr/binance-api) and [IEX](https://iexcloud.io/docs/api/#api-reference) API.

## Tech stack
NodeJS | ExpressJS | MongoDB | Mongoose

## Features  
On our app, just like a classic paper trading app, you can **buy** 📈 stocks/cryptos and **sell** 📉 them.

## Model

  - email
  - password
